    tastingNotes:
      "The aromatics of 2017 Barolo Ravera are an intricacy of red tones, with cherry, rose petals, baked raspberry alongside with orange peel, cedar, korla pear and herbal whiffles of mint, lavender, thyme, oolong tea. The palate is characterized by a zing of iron tones and the mid-palate volume that are such a signature of Ravera, with silky tannins and a profound and long finish.",
